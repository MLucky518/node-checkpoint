## Using These Examples

You can copy these files to your own migrations directory and modify them as needed.

**Note**: These examples use PostgreSQL syntax. For MySQL, you would need to adjust:
- `SERIAL` â†’ `INT AUTO_INCREMENT`
- Column types may vary slightly

## Testing the Examples

1. Copy `migration.config.example.js` to `migration.config.js`
2. Update database credentials
3. Copy example migrations to your migrations directory
4. Run migrations:
   ```bash
   checkpoint up
   ```

5. Check status:
   ```bash
   checkpoint status
   ```

6. Rollback if needed:
   ```bash
   checkpoint down
   ```
